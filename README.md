script to download bouquet as vlc playlist

sorry I'm learning python so code is for sure not optimal but creates for me working vlc playlist :)

how to use?

a) update by ip address of your device in all lines where you see http://192.168.0.11<br/>
b) change userbouquet.dbe00.tv to userbouquet.dbe01.tv etc to iterate next bouquests<br/>
c) update place to write playlist<br/>

ip_addr="192.168.0.11"<br/>
bouquet="userbouquet.dbe00.tv"<br/>
fajl="/home/pi/plajlista.xspf"<br/>

save and run

no licence, have fun :)
